My research focuses on understanding gravitational N-body dynamics in planetary systems. 
This includes a range of topics, from measuring planet masses and orbits via dynamical
modeling to understanding the long-term evolution of planets' orbits.

Transit Timing Variations
-------------------------
 When multiple planets orbit the same star, their mutual gravitational interactions
 cause their orbits to deviate from perfect Keplerian ellipses. 
 These deviation can be detected in the arrival times of the planets' transits, 
 which will not be perfectly evenly spaced.
 While these transit timing variations or 'TTVs' can provide exquisitely sensitive probes of small planets
 masses and eccentricities, going from a set of TTVs
 to measurements of planet masses and orbits poses a difficult inverse problem.
 I've worked extensively on developing and applying methods for 
 measuring the masses and eccentricitites of transiting planets using TTVs. 

 The plot below, taken from 
[Hadden & Lithwick (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154....5H/abstract) 
, shows mass measurements for 145 transiting *Kepler* planets that I derived by modeling their TTVs. These measurements show that sub-Neptune planets are frequently covered with significant gaseous envelopes, constituting up to ~10% of their total mass.

Long-term Dynamical Evolution
-----------------------------
I also work on understanding dynamical evolution in planetary systems.
This work has touched on a range of topics, from the dynamical evolution of trans-Neptunian objects in the presence of a hypothetical ‘Planet 9’ to the dynamics of mean motion resonances and orbital chaos.
