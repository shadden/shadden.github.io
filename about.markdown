I'm currently a CfA Fellow at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics][cfa].
My reserach focuses on understanding gravitational dynamics in planetary systems.
I apply this understanding in order to make sense of exoplanet observations such
as transit timing and radial velocity measurements. I also work to understand the 
role of gravitational dynamics in the long-term evolution of planetary systems.

I received my PhD in Physics and Astronomy from Northwestern University in 2017.
