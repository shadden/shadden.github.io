I am an astrophysicist and currently a postdoctoral fellow and the [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics][cita]. My reserach focuses on the gravitational dynamics of planetary systems, including our solar system. I try to make sense of exoplanet observations such as transit timing and radial velocity measurements. I also work to understand the role of gravitational dynamics in the long-term evolution of planetary systems. Recently, I have 

Previously, I was a CfA Fellow at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics][cfa].

Before that, I received my PhD in Physics and Astronomy from Northwestern University in 2017.
