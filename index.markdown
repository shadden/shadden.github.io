I am an astrophysicist and currently a postdoctoral fellow and the [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics][cita]. Previously, I was a CfA Fellow at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics][cfa]. Before that, I received my PhD in Physics and Astronomy from Northwestern University in 2017.

My [research](research) focuses on the orbital dynamics of planetary systems, including our solar system. This has included dynamical modeling of exoplanet observations, such as transit timing and radial velocity measurements, in order to measure masses and orbital properties. I also work to understand how planetary systems' formation and long-term dynamical evolution are refelcted in their orbital architectures. 

Lately, I have also been working on some problems in galactic dynamics.
